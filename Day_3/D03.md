# Q&A

# Notes
- `fred = "Sally" or "Daniel"`?
- `del`
- variable names: `str`/`int`
- `Cmd+b`

# checkup
- on debugging
  - What is a "syntax error"?
    - Think Python Appendix:
        > Syntax errors are discovered by the interpreter when it is translating the source code into byte code. They indicate that there is something wrong with the structure of the program. Example: Omitting the colon at the end of a `def` statement generates the somewhat redundant message `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

- Can an integer be negative?
- How can you tell if a number is an integer, a floating point, or a string?
- What is "PEP8"?
- What does `dir()` do?
- Why does Python require code to be indented?
- Where do `import` statements go?
- Can you use math operators with strings?
- What is "scope"?
- How do I create strings with a single quote within them?
- How do I create strings with a double-quotes within them?

# review
- review our comments
- w/ each other's code
  - readability
  - explainability
  - maintainability
  - extensibility
  - workability
  - look at: names, structure, whitespace, comments, logical flow

# type comparison
```
>>> a = "4"
>>> b = "4"
>>> c = "3"
>>> a > b+c
False
>>> a > c+b
True
```

# strings
## slicing
- strings are a "string" of characters.
  - i.e. bananas is, roughly, 'b' 'a' 'n' 'a' 'n' 'a' 's'
- we can "index" into strings (known in Python as slicing)

```
x = "UC Berkeley"
x[0]    # ?
x[1]    # ?
x[0:1]  # ?
X[0:2]  # ?
x[2:6]  # ?
x[-4:]  # ?
```

---

```
x = "UC Berkeley"
x[0]    # 'U'
x[1]    # 'C'
x[0:1]  # 'U'
X[0:2]  # 'UC'
x[2:6]  # ' Ber'
x[-4:]  # 'eley'
```

## string methods

- Python Documentation: [4.7.1. String Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
  - Ex: `rjust`

```
x = "UC Berkeley  "
x.replace("UC","University of California,")
x.split()    # ?
x.split('k') # ?
x.strip()    # ?
```

---

```
x = "UC Berkeley  "
x.replace("UC","University of California,")
x.split()    # ['UC', 'Berkeley  ']
x.split('k') # ['UC Ber', 'eley  ']
x.strip()    # "UC Berkeley"
```
