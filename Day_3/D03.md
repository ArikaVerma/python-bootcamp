# warmup
- growing names
- What is something *not* everyone knows about you?

# Q&A

# Notes
- `fred = "Sally" or "Daniel"`?
- `del`
- variable names: `str`/`int`
- `Cmd+b`
- Has anyone used PythonTutor?

# checkup
<div class="incremental">
- on debugging
  - What is a "syntax error"?
    - Think Python Appendix:

        > Syntax errors are discovered by the interpreter when it is translating the source code into byte code. They indicate that there is something wrong with the structure of the program. Example: Omitting the colon at the end of a `def` statement generates the somewhat redundant message `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

  - Think Python 3.12 Debugging:
  
    > As [PERSON] pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”


  - Think Python 5.12 Debugging:

    > When a syntax or runtime error occurs, the error message contains a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are usually:  
    > • What kind of error it was, and  
    > • [?????].

- Can an integer be negative?
- Can I use commas in my integers?  (e.g.  `mil = 1,000,000`)
- How can you tell if a number is an integer, a floating point, or a string?
- What is "PEP8"?
- What does `dir()` do?
- Can I indent my python code with 7 spaces?
- Why does Python require code to be indented?
- Where do `import` statements go?
- What is syntax highlighting?
- What is "wrong" with this code?
  - `print ("hello world")`
  - `username= "danielsgriffin"`
- What is the modulo operator and what does it do?
  - A: modulo (`%`) “yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second”
- Can you use math operators with strings?
- What is "scope"?
- How do I create strings with a single quote within them?
- How do I create strings with a double-quotes within them?

# review
- review my comments
- w/ each other's code
  - readability
  - explainability
  - maintainability
  - extensibility
  - workability
  - `import this`
  - look at: names, structure, whitespace, comments, logical flow

## Python Documentation: [5.8. Comparing Sequences and Other Types](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-types)
> Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses *lexicographical* ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison;


~~~ {.sourceCode}
>>> ord(a)
52
>>> ord(c)
51
>>> chr(51)
'3'
~~~

---

## Python Documentation: [2. Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

### [`ord(c)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord)
> Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character. For example, `ord('a')` returns the integer `97` and `ord('€')` (Euro sign) returns `8364`. This is the inverse of `chr()`.

### [`chr(i)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr)
> Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i. For example, `chr(97)` returns the string `'a'`, while `chr(8364)` returns the string `'€'`. This is the inverse of `ord()`.

~~~ {.sourceCode}
>>> for number in range(33,100):
...     print(number, chr(number))
~~~


# getting user input
## during execution
use `input()`

~~~ {.python}
user_age = input('What is your age? ')
next_age = int(user_age) + 1
print("Current age is " + user_age)
print("Next year, you'll be " + str(next_age))
~~~

`input()` will accept input until the first newline (`'\n'`). basically, until you hit enter.

## from command-line

~~~ {.sourceCode}
$ python myapp.py ARG1 ARG2 ARG3
~~~
</br>

~~~ {.python}
import sys

def main():
    print(sys.argv, type(sys.argv))
    print(len(sys.argv))
    print(sys.argv[0])
    print(sys.argv[1])
~~~

---

### what if there is no cmd-line input?

~~~ {.sourceCode}
$ python myapp.py
~~~
</br>

~~~ {.python}
def main():
    # Expects parameters (1,2)
    print(sys.argv, type(sys.argv))
    print(len(sys.argv))
    print(sys.argv[1])
    print(sys.argv[2])
~~~

---

~~~ {.sourceCode}
$ python myapp.py
~~~
</br>

~~~ {.python}
def main():
    # Expects parameters (1,2,3)
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        sys.exit("C'mon, use ALL the params")

    print(sys.argv, type(sys.argv))
    print(sys.argv[1])
    print(sys.argv[2])
    print(sys.argv[3])

# strings
## slicing
- strings are a "string" of characters.
  - i.e. bananas is, roughly, 'b' 'a' 'n' 'a' 'n' 'a' 's'
- we can "index" into strings (known in Python as slicing)

~~~ {.python}
x = "UC Berkeley"
x[0]    # ?
x[1]    # ?
x[0:1]  # ?
X[0:2]  # ?
x[2:6]  # ?
x[-4:]  # ?
~~~

---

~~~ {.python}
x = "UC Berkeley"
x[0]    # 'U'
x[1]    # 'C'
x[0:1]  # 'U'
X[0:2]  # 'UC'
x[2:6]  # ' Ber'
x[-4:]  # 'eley'
~~~

---

## string methods

- Python Documentation: [4.7.1. String Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
  - Ex: `rjust`

~~~ {.python}
x = "UC Berkeley  "
x.replace("UC","University of California,")
x.split()    # ?
x.split('k') # ?
x.strip()    # ?
~~~

---

~~~ {.python}
x = "UC Berkeley  "
x.replace("UC","University of California,")
x.split()    # ['UC', 'Berkeley  ']
x.split('k') # ['UC Ber', 'eley  ']
x.strip()    # "UC Berkeley"
~~~
