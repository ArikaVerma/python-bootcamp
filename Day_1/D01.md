  - D01 - first half: Introduction, Setup, Variables, Style, Scope
  - D01 - second half: Operations, Input, Conditionals, If-Else, Loops, Try-Except
- then: strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, classes

# daily
- Q&A
  - InfoCamp
- review
- checkups
  - "tests"
- new material
  - slides
- exercises
- breaks

# development environment
- text editor
- command-line
- Python 3
- also
  - GitHub
  - Jupyter Notebook

# command line
- why?
- how?
- let’s start...

# the file system
- `ls` or `dir` list files
- `cd`          change directory
- `mkdir`       make directory
- `cd` or `pwd` present working directory

# little things
- `clear`
- `history`
- `↑`
- `[control + C]`
- `[tab-autocompletion]`
- `whatis COMMAND`
- `man COMMAND`
  - `q`

# little things - practice
- `whatis whatis`
- `man whatis`
- `whatis man`
- `man man`

# the file system - practice
| | |
--- | ---
|`$ pwd`  | # print the working directory |
|`$ cd ..`| # change directory parent dir |
|`$ pwd`  | # print the (new) working directory |
|`$ cd /` | # change directory to root dir (/) |
|`$ ls /` | # list files in root directory (/) |
|`$ cd`   | # change directory to home dir |
|`$ ls`   | # list files in directory |

# practice: interacting with files
- `$ pwd`           # we’re in our home directory
- `$ mkdir this`

Remove that directory.

- `$ rm this`       # failed. files may exist
- `$ rm -r this`

# GitHub: exercises and "homework"
- get git/GitHub

# Python - version
version: #.#?

`$ python3 --version`

# Python - hello
```
>>> print("Hello Littlest Bear")

>>> Hello Littlest Bear
```

# Python - hello script
- on your computer, open your favorite editor
- write the following line:
```
print("hello world")
```
- save the file as `helloworld.py` [where?]
- on your computer’s terminal execute the file:
```
$ python3 helloworld.py
```

### Think Python: 2.3 Expressions and statements
> An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators.

> A **statement** is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.

# bitwise operators
### Think Python: 1.4 Arithmetic operators

Finally, the operator ** performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:  
> >>> 6\*\*2 + 6  
> 42  
In some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:  
> >>> 6 ^ 2  
> 4  
I won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators>.  

*Note: Below we will see `^` as a Boolean operator.*

### Stack Overflow: ["Real world use cases of bitwise operators"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2096916/real-world-use-cases-of-bitwise-operators)

### Python Docs: [15. Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) (again)
> While pathological cases do exist, for most casual use of floating-point arithmetic you’ll see the result you expect in the end if you simply round the display of your final results to the number of decimal digits you expect.

### Python Docs: [6.1.3. Format String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/string.html#formatstrings)

# python - history and philosophy
- Guido van Rossum (BDFL):

> Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas…

- Notes:
  - scripts
  - objects
  - functions
  - `import this`
    - [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
    - PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal

# variables
## variable types
- a variable can be a boolean:
  - `True`, `False`
- a variable can be an integer:
  - `4`, `-17`, `0`,  `4034282792`
- a variable can be a floating point:
  - `4.1`,  `-17.00000023`, `0.0`, `4.034E9`

### strings
*Note: strings are immutable: cannot be mutated, or changed*

- `"Proxima"`, `'Michael'`
- `"Michael says this is a string"`
- `'Proxima says "this too"'`
- `"Daniel: \"and more strings!\" "`
- `"21"` or `'21'`    # Strings, not integers
- `"Monty Python'`  # SyntaxError


### variables as containers
*(we'll come back to these later)*

- objects:  (user created data type)
  - containers of strings, ints, objects, etc.
  - created by you or imported with a library
- collections:  strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries.
  - called "data structures", these are "native"
  - containers of other strings, ints, objects

### variable names
*Note: can't start w/ numbers, can't use **Python keywords***

- Java and C++ are “strongly typed”
  - i.e they make authors declare var. type
    - `int fahrenheit = 72`
- Python is loosely typed and has no such worries

```
>>> temp = 72
>>> Temp = 80
>>> print(str(temp) + " " + str(Temp))
```

- conversation re the fuzzy ecosystem

# help!
- search/'google' when you’re stuck
  - looking for: browse/explore, orienteering, teleporting
  - docs.python.org/3.7/
  - stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python
  - Google: "site:python.org/ [terms]" OR "[terms] python"
  - Ctrl+F/Cmd+F
- then (please!) write down and share tomorrow what you learn
  - (or what you don’t learn)
- please message me on Slack if you’re stuck, but you’ll learn more if *first*:
  - try searching AND explain your problem to a classmate

# lab time
Today we will use this time to make sure people's systems are setup, GitHub, Slack, text editors, to play around on the command line, or start on homework.
