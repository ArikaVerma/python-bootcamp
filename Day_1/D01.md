# development environment
- text editor
- command-line
- Python 3
- also
  - GitHub
  - Jupyter Notebook

# command line
- why?
- how?
- let’s start...

# the file system
- `ls` or `dir` list files
- `cd`          change directory
- `mkdir`       make directory
- `cd` or `pwd` present working directory

# little things
- `clear`
- `history`
- `↑`
- `[control + C]`
- `[tab-autocompletion]`
- `whatis COMMAND`
- `man COMMAND`
  - `q`

# little things - practice
- `whatis whatis`
- `man whatis`
- `whatis man`
- `man man`

# the file system - practice
| | |
--- | ---
|`$ pwd`  | # print the working directory |
|`$ cd ..`| # change directory parent dir |
|`$ pwd`  | # print the (new) working directory |
|`$ cd /` | # change directory to root dir (/) |
|`$ ls /` | # list files in root directory (/) |
|`$ cd`   | # change directory to home dir |
|`$ ls`   | # list files in directory |

# practice: interacting with files
- `$ pwd`           # we’re in our home directory
- `$ mkdir this`

Remove that directory.

- `$ rm this`       # failed. files may exist
- `$ rm -r this`

version: #.#?

`$ python3 --version`

```
$ python3   # start interactive shell

# help!
- search/'google' when you’re stuck
  - looking for: browse/explore, orienteering, teleporting
  - docs.python.org/3.7/
  - stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python
  - Google: "site:python.org/ [terms]" OR "[terms] python"
  - Ctrl+F/Cmd+F
- then (please!) write down and share tomorrow what you learn
  - (or what you don’t learn)
- please message me on Slack if you’re stuck, but you’ll learn more if *first*:
  - try searching AND explain your problem to a classmate

# lab time
Today we will use this time to make sure people's systems are setup, GitHub, Slack, text editors, to play around on the command line, or start on homework.
